Tunable thresholds for Part 5 (Evidence Validation, Confidence & Response
Generation).

Every threshold here is a judgment call the architecture doc leaves to the
implementer. Nothing else in this package hardcodes a magic number outside
this file — change behavior by editing these constants, not by hunting
through validator.py / confidence.py / claim_check.py.

# task when `CoregistrationResult.aligned` is False (see Part 2 hardening),
# but Part 5 checks again in case that call path ever changes.
#
# Bug fix (found alongside the tiling-refusal marker below): this was
# "coregistration" with no hyphen, but agent/planner.py's _refusal_evidence
# has only ever written the warning as "co-registration refusal: ...", with
# one — every docstring and schema name elsewhere in this codebase spells it
# the same way. The unhyphenated marker never matched, so this path silently
# fell through to the generic "no usable signal" abstain message below
# instead of the specific one a few lines down in validator.py. No crash —
# both are a clean abstain — but the specific message is the whole point of
# this check existing, so it's worth matching correctly.

# --- Numeric claim-check tolerance -----------------------------------------
# Two numbers are treated as "the same fact" if they match after rounding to
# this many decimal places, OR are within this relative tolerance of one
# another. This exists so ordinary natural-language rounding ("about 12%"
# for a true value of 12.4) doesn't get flagged as fabrication, while a
# genuinely invented number (87% for a true value of 12.4) still is. 5% was
# chosen as generous enough for that kind of rounding, tight enough that it
# won't wave through a materially different number.

# numeric claim-check failure — before giving up and using the fully
# templated, non-LLM sentence (which is guaranteed to pass by construction).
