"""
Two small in-memory stores. Neither is a cross-part contract — they exist
because Part 2 owns the API surface and the job queue needs somewhere to
resolve `image_ids` (from POST /api/query) back to the ImageMetadata that
POST /api/upload produced earlier.

ImageStore: image_id -> ImageMetadata, populated by every successful upload.

UploadSessionStore: tracks in-progress chunked uploads (Section 3.2 hardening:
"Resumable chunked handling on /api/upload for large files"). This is
deliberately simple — Section 7 explicitly permits "tus or basic chunking",
not a from-scratch protocol: the client sends `total_chunks` + `chunk_index`
+ an `upload_id` (self-picked on the first chunk), the server writes each
chunk to its own file and reports back which indices it has, and a client
that dropped mid-upload can resume by re-sending only the chunks missing
from that list — no separate status endpoint needed. In-memory is enough
for a single-process demo deployment (Section 7: "single-deployment demo");
a real multi-worker deployment would back this with shared storage instead.

Swapped for a real datastore during integration if needed — nothing outside
this file knows these are in-memory.
